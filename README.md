Gemini Watermark Tool removes Gemini visible watermarks from images using a **mathematically accurate reverse alpha blending algorithm**.  
Unlike many tools that rely entirely on generative inpainting, this project focuses on **deterministic reconstruction** combined with lightweight AI-assisted cleanup.

The design philosophy is simple:  
**small, standalone, fast, and reliable.**

The entire toolkit is distributed as a **portable executable with zero runtime dependencies**, making it easy to install, automate, and integrate into scripts or pipelines without complex setup.

Key capabilities include:

- **Fast & offline**: single executable, **no external services or dependencies**
- **Standalone & portable**: small footprint, easy to deploy and use anywhere
- **GUI + CLI**: drag-and-drop desktop workflow or command-line automation
- **Deterministic watermark reconstruction**: reverse alpha blending algorithm designed specifically for Gemini watermark overlays
- **AI-assisted cleanup**: optional GPU-accelerated FDnCNN denoise (NCNN + Vulkan) for residual artifacts
- **Smart detection**: three-stage NCC detection with confidence scoring to automatically skip non-watermarked images
- **Batch processing**: process entire directories with preview and progress tracking
- **Cross-platform**: Windows / Linux / macOS / Android (CLI)
- **AI Agent ready**: [Claude Code Skill + MCP Server](https://github.com/allenk/gwt-integrations) for automation and agent workflows

## 🖥️ GUI Application — Major Update

> **GeminiWatermarkTool now comes with a full graphical desktop application.**
> No command line needed — just open, drag & drop, and process. Supports single-image editing with real-time preview, and batch processing with smart watermark detection.

The desktop GUI provides an interactive workflow for both single-image and batch operations.

![GUI Demo](artworks/gui_demo.png)

## AI Agent - Integration (New in v0.2.5)
GeminiWatermarkTool can now be integrated into AI-agent workflows via MCP server and Claude Code skills.
This enables automated watermark processing inside agent-based pipelines.

> **[gwt-integrations](https://github.com/allenk/gwt-integrations)** — Claude Code Skill + MCP Server for GeminiWatermarkTool

Enable AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) to use GeminiWatermarkTool directly:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Claude Code Skill** | Teaches AI agents GWT's full CLI syntax, region/snap/denoise options, and best practices — agents can remove watermarks from images without manual guidance |
| **MCP Server** | Exposes GWT as 4 tools via [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) — `remove_watermark`, `detect_watermark`, `batch_process`, `get_tool_info` — any MCP-compatible client can call them |
| **install.py** | Cross-platform installer (stdlib only) — auto-detects GWT binary, configures Claude Code skill and MCP server in one command |


![AI MCP Skill](artworks/gwt-mcp.gif)

### Single Image Editing

![GUI Single Image](artworks/gui_single.gif)

- Drag & drop or open any supported image
- Auto-detect watermark size (48×48 / 96×96) or select manually
- **Custom watermark mode**: draw a search region interactively, resize with 8-point anchors, fine-tune position with WASD keys
- **Multi-scale guided detection (Snap Engine)**: coarse-to-fine NCC template matching auto-locks to the exact watermark position within your drawn region — supports variable sizes from 16–320px with adjustable Min Size and Max Size sliders (Min Size default 16px covers Gemini preview-tier watermarks ~28px)
- Real-time before/after comparison (press **V**)
- One-key processing (**X**) and revert (**Z**)
- Zoom, pan (Space/Alt + drag, mouse wheel), and fit-to-window

### Software Inpainting Cleanup (New in v0.2.3)

![Software Inpainting](artworks/gui_inpaint_sw.gif)

Reverse alpha blending is mathematically exact — but only when the image hasn't been resized, recompressed, or processed after watermarking. In practice, many images go through post-processing that breaks the pixel-perfect math, leaving faint residual artifacts after removal.

**Software Inpainting** addresses this by applying a lightweight cleanup pass after the reverse blending step. It uses gradient-weighted masks derived from the watermark's own alpha channel to target only the residual pixels, leaving the rest of the image untouched.

Three built-in methods are available:

| Method | Description | Best for |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **NS** | Navier-Stokes based inpainting — propagates surrounding pixel flow into the damaged region | General-purpose cleanup with smooth results |
| **TELEA** | Fast marching method — fills inward from boundary pixels based on distance weighting | Quick processing, good for small residuals |
| **Soft Inpaint** | Gradient-weighted Gaussian blend — uses the watermark alpha as a soft mask for weighted blending | Preserving fine texture in photographic content |

The cleanup controls appear automatically in **Custom** mode under the Detected Info panel. You can adjust the **method**, **strength** (0–100%), and **inpaint radius** (1–25 px) to fine-tune the result.

### AI Denoise — FDnCNN Neural Network (New in v0.2.5)

![AI Denoise](artworks/gui_inpaint_ai_fdncnn.gif)

**AI Denoise** uses a GPU-accelerated neural network ([FDnCNN](https://github.com/cszn/KAIR)) to clean up watermark residuals that conventional inpainting methods struggle with — particularly the faint sparkle edges and corner artifacts left after reverse alpha blending on resized images.

Unlike NS/TELEA which require a binary mask to know *which* pixels are damaged, AI Denoise examines a 41×41 pixel neighborhood around each point and learns from training data what "normal" image content looks like. Combined with gradient-masked blending from the alpha map, it repairs only the artifact pixels while preserving clean background detail.

| Parameter | Range | Default | Description |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Strength** | 0–300% | 120% | Controls mask coverage — values above 100% expand repair to weaker gradient edges |
| **Sigma** | 1–150 | 50 | Noise level estimation — higher values denoise more aggressively |

**Technical details:**
- **Model**: FDnCNN Color, 20-layer Conv+ReLU, FP16 (~1.3 MB embedded in executable)
- **Inference**: [NCNN](https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn) with Vulkan GPU acceleration, automatic CPU fallback
- **Pipeline**: gradient mask from alpha map → NCNN inference on padded ROI → per-pixel masked blend
- **Performance**: < 5 ms per region on modern GPUs, ~20 ms on CPU

AI Denoise is the **recommended default** when available. The GPU device name is displayed below the controls. If GPU initialization fails, the tool automatically falls back to NS inpainting.

### Batch Processing

<!-- TODO: Replace with actual GIF -->
![GUI Batch Processing](artworks/gui_batch.gif)

- **Drag & drop** multiple files or an **entire folder** to enter batch mode
- Thumbnail atlas preview with filename labels and status overlays (OK / SKIP / FAIL)
- **Detection threshold slider** (0–100%, 5% steps, 25% recommended) — automatically skip images without watermarks
- Confirmation dialog before overwriting originals
- Non-blocking processing with progress bar and scrollable result log
- Thumbnails refresh after completion to show processed results

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| X | Process image |
| V | Compare with original |
| Z | Revert to original |
| C (hold) | Hide overlay |
| W A S D | Move custom watermark region |
| Space / Alt | Pan (hold + drag) |
| Scroll | Zoom to cursor |
| Ctrl +/- | Zoom in / out |
| Ctrl 0 | Zoom fit |
| Ctrl+W | Close / exit batch mode |

### Render Backends (Windows)

The GUI supports multiple render backends for maximum compatibility:

| Backend | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **D3D11** (default) | Direct3D 11 with WARP fallback | Best for Windows — works in Hyper-V, Docker, RDP |
| **OpenGL** | OpenGL 3.3 Core | Cross-platform, requires GPU drivers |

**Why D3D11?**
- Native Windows API — no additional drivers needed
- **WARP fallback** — software rendering when no GPU available
- Works in **Hyper-V**, **Docker**, **Remote Desktop**, and other virtualized environments
- Better stability in Windows sandbox configurations

```bash
# Auto-select (D3D11 on Windows, OpenGL elsewhere)
GeminiWatermarkTool

# Force specific backend
GeminiWatermarkTool --backend=d3d11
GeminiWatermarkTool --backend=opengl
```

## CLI — What's New

In addition to the GUI, the command line has been significantly enhanced.

### Simple Mode — Now Supports Multiple Files

```bash
# Process multiple files at once (new!)
GeminiWatermarkTool img1.jpg img2.png img3.webp
```

Watermark detection is **enabled by default** in simple mode — images without a detectable watermark are automatically skipped to prevent accidental damage.

```bash
# Force processing without detection
GeminiWatermarkTool --force image.jpg

# Custom detection threshold (default: 25%)
GeminiWatermarkTool --threshold 0.40 image.jpg
```

### Standard Mode

```bash
# Single file with explicit output
GeminiWatermarkTool -i input.jpg -o output.jpg

# Batch directory processing
GeminiWatermarkTool -i ./watermarked_images/ -o ./clean_images/
```

## Watermark Detection

> Inspired by [@dannycreations](https://github.com/dannycreations)'s [contribution](https://github.com/allenk/GeminiWatermarkTool/pull/13) on watermark presence detection. We took the concept further with a production-grade three-stage algorithm deeply integrated into both CLI and GUI workflows.

Batch processing watermark-free images can cause unnecessary pixel damage. The tool now uses a **three-stage NCC (Normalized Cross-Correlation)** algorithm to detect watermarks before processing, ensuring only watermarked images are modified:

1. **Spatial NCC** — correlates the image region with the known alpha map (50% weight, with circuit breaker at 0.25 to short-circuit obvious non-matches)
2. **Gradient NCC** — Sobel edge matching to detect the star-shaped structural pattern (30% weight)
3. **Statistical Variance** — texture dampening analysis to distinguish real watermarks from white/flat regions (20% weight)

A combined confidence score determines whether a watermark is present. The default threshold is **25%** — images below this score are skipped. This eliminates false positives from white backgrounds or similar-looking content that plagued simpler correlation-based approaches.

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--force` | Skip detection, process all images unconditionally |
| `--threshold 0.40` | Set custom confidence threshold (0.0–1.0) |
| `--no-banner` | Hide ASCII banner (for scripts and AI agents) |
| `--banner` | Force show ASCII banner |

Detection is **enabled by default** in simple/drag-and-drop mode and **disabled by default** in standard (`-i` / `-o`) mode. In the GUI, the threshold is adjustable via a slider (0–100%, 5% steps) with a recommended 25% default.

## Demo

## Side by Side Comparison

![Comparison](artworks/comparison.png)
Best for: **slides, documents, UI screenshots, diagrams, logos**.

**Focus on the bottom example (text-heavy slide).**  
Generative inpainting often breaks text: warped edges, wrong spacing, invented strokes.  
GeminiWatermarkTool reverses the blending equation to recover pixels, keeping text crisp.

## ⚠️ About SynthID (Invisible Watermark)

> **Important**: This tool removes **visible watermarks only**. It does NOT remove SynthID.

### What is SynthID?

SynthID is Google DeepMind's **invisible watermarking** technology embedded in AI-generated images. Unlike visible watermarks:

- **Invisible** to human eyes
- **Integrated** during generation (not added afterward)  
- **Extremely robust** against common image manipulations

### Why Can't SynthID Be Removed?

Our extensive research revealed a fundamental truth:

> **SynthID is not a watermark added to an image — it IS the image.**

SynthID operates as a **Statistical Bias** during generation. Every pixel choice is subtly influenced by Google's private key using **Tournament Sampling**. The watermark and visual content are **inseparably bound**.

```
Visible Watermark:  Image + Overlay = Result     ✓ Removable (this tool)
SynthID:            Biased Generation = Image    ✗ Cannot separate
```

### Potential Removal Approaches

| Approach | Trade-off | Feasibility |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Extreme Quantization** (binarization) | Image becomes unusable skeleton | ✓ Works |
| **AI Repaint** (Stable Diffusion, etc.) | Style changes significantly | ✓ Works |
| **White-box Adversarial Attack** | Requires detector model | ✗ Not available |

**Conclusion**: Removing SynthID while preserving image quality is **currently not feasible**.

| `tr:mx,my,w,h` | Top-right corner |
| `tl:mx,my,w,h` | Top-left (same as absolute) |
| `br:auto` | Use Gemini default position based on image size |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Standard removal with AI denoise cleanup
GeminiWatermarkTool -i input.jpg -o clean.jpg --denoise ai

# Batch with AI denoise (all files)
GeminiWatermarkTool -i ./photos/ -o ./clean/ --denoise ai

# Fallback for images that fail detection: search bottom-right area with snap
GeminiWatermarkTool -i ./photos/ -o ./clean/ \
    --fallback-region br:auto --snap --denoise ai

# Resized watermarks: expand snap search to 320px
GeminiWatermarkTool -i ./photos/ -o ./clean/ \
    --fallback-region br:80,80,200,200 --snap --snap-max-size 320 --denoise ai

# Gemini preview images (small ~28px watermark): use lower snap-threshold
GeminiWatermarkTool -i preview.jpg -o clean.jpg \
    --fallback-region br:auto --snap --snap-threshold 0.30 --denoise ai --sigma 13 --strength 175

# Force process at explicit region (all images have watermark at same spot)
GeminiWatermarkTool -i ./photos/ -o ./clean/ \
    --force --region 500,800,160,160 --snap --denoise ai --sigma 75
```

> **Note:** When no `--denoise` is specified, the CLI behaves identically to previous versions (no cleanup pass). All existing scripts and agent integrations continue to work unchanged.

## Watermark Size Detection

The tool automatically detects the appropriate watermark size based on image dimensions:

| Image Size | Watermark | Position |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| W ≤ 1024 **or** H ≤ 1024 | 48×48 | Bottom-right, 32px margin |
| W > 1024 **and** H > 1024 | 96×96 | Bottom-right, 64px margin |

Use `--force-small` or `--force-large` to override automatic detection.

## System Requirements

| Platform | Requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| Windows | Windows 10/11 x64 |
| Linux | x64, glibc 2.35+ (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+) |
| macOS | macOS 11.0+ (Intel or Apple Silicon) |
| Android | ARM64, Android 10+ (API 29+) |

All binaries are statically linked with no external runtime dependencies.

> **AI Denoise** uses Vulkan for GPU acceleration. Most modern GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel) with up-to-date drivers support Vulkan. If no Vulkan GPU is detected, inference automatically falls back to CPU (OpenMP multi-threaded).

## Troubleshooting

### "The image doesn't look different after processing"

The watermark is semi-transparent. If the original background was similar to the watermark color, the difference may be subtle. Try viewing at 100% zoom in the watermark area (bottom-right corner).

### "Wrong watermark size detected"

Use `--force-small` or `--force-large` to manually specify:

```bash
GeminiWatermarkTool -i image.jpg -o output.jpg --force-small
```

### "File access denied"

Make sure the output path is writable and the file isn't open in another program.

## Limitations

- Only removes **Gemini visible watermarks** (the semi-transparent logo in bottom-right)
- Does **NOT** remove **SynthID invisible watermarks** — [see why](report/synthid_research.md)
- Designed for Gemini's current watermark pattern (as of 2025)

## How It Works

### Gemini Watermark Analysis

Gemini applies visible watermarks using **alpha blending**:

```
watermarked = α × logo + (1 - α) × original
```

### Alpha Reconstruction

By statistically analyzing and comparing values related to Alpha, we can reconstruct an Alpha Map that is either correct or very close to it.

### Removal Algorithm (Reverse Alpha Blending)

Solving for the original pixel:

```
original = (watermarked - α × logo) / (1 - α)
         = (watermarked - alpha_map) / (1 - α)
```

This mathematical inversion produces exact restoration of the original pixels.

### Residual Cleanup (Software Inpainting + AI Denoise)

When images have been resized or recompressed after watermarking, the exact math no longer holds perfectly. Two approaches are available for cleaning up residual artifacts:

**Software Inpainting** (NS / TELEA / Gaussian):
```
1. Compute gradient magnitude from watermark alpha channel
2. Build soft weight mask: stronger where alpha gradient is high
3. Apply selected inpainting method (NS / TELEA / Gaussian blend)
4. Blend result using weight mask — only affected pixels are modified
```

**AI Denoise** (FDnCNN, recommended):
```
1. Compute gradient mask from alpha map (locate sparkle edges)
2. Run FDnCNN inference on padded ROI (Vulkan GPU or CPU)
   Input:  [R, G, B, sigma/255] → Output: denoised clean image
3. Per-pixel masked blend: mask × denoised + (1-mask) × original
   → Only edge artifacts repaired, clean background untouched
```
